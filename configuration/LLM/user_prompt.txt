Summarize the following numbered student comments from an instructor course evaluation into four sections: Positives, Neutral/Mixed, Negatives, and Summary.

Requirements
- Use the Feedback IDs (the numbers attached to each comment). In every bullet under Positives/Neutral/Mixed/Negatives, start with a parenthetical list of contributing IDs in ascending order:
  - (Feedbacks 5, 18, 23) 3 students …
  - (Feedback 12) 1 student …
- Ensure the numeric count equals the number of unique IDs listed. If >6 IDs contribute, show the first 5 ascending, then “… +N more”.
- Identify and count common sentiments using the thresholds in the system prompt.
- Include 1–2 ID items only if clearly alarming/critical; otherwise exclude one-offs.
- Keep bullets concise (≈20 words). Redact any names/identifiers.
- End with a brief, impartial Summary stating the overall tone (Positive/Negative/Mixed) per the 60% rule.
